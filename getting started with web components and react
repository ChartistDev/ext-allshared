# Getting Started with ExtWebComponents and React.js

Note:  This approach does not utilize @sencha/ext-webpack-plugin

## Login to Sencha npm repository

If you haven't already, log into Sencha's private registry using the credentials you received in your ExtWebComponents trial or subscription activation email. If you don't have credentials, you can get them by [signing up for a trial of ExtWebComponents](https://www.sencha.com/products/extwebcomponents/evaluate/).

Early Adopter
```bash
npm login --registry=https://sencha.myget.org/F/early-adopter/npm/ --scope=@sencha
```

## Create a React application

1 - Run `create-react-app`

    $ npx create-react-app ewc-react-app
    
    $ cd ewc-react-app

2 - Add to package.json:

- In 'scripts' section:

      "install": "node ./node_modules/@sencha/ext-all/install-react.js",

- In 'dependencies' section: 

        "@sencha/ext-web-components": "~7.0.0",
        "@sencha/ext-all": "~7.0.0",

3 - Run `npm install` (for lerna: run `npm install` at the root)
